        "title": "How the Naples Market Has Grown Since Last Summer",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today letâs take a look at how the Naples-area market has changed since last year.In todayâs market report for the summer of 2019, we first want to clear up the misconception that summer is a slow time for the Naples market. People tend to believe that nobody buys in the summer and that you can only list your house in the winter months because thatâs when everybody is here, but thatâs just not true.As of July 2019, our agents have had 17,000 appointments to show various properties in the Naples area, which is fantastic. To dig even deeper into that, we also found that each buyer averaged 17 showings before making a purchase. Keep that in mind if you havenât found the right home by your fifth or so home tour.For inventory, we had about 5,200 homes on the market in July this year, including condos and single-family homes.Our current list-to-sold ratio in the market is 96%, and our list-to-sales price ratio was 90%. Kimberley and I happen to get an average of 97% of the listing price for our sellers, which is a pretty good market total.âOverall, our market is really on an upswing.âIn July, we closed 435 single-family home sales and 394 condo sales.Overall, sellers added 935 new listings to the market. The interesting part about that is that even with 935 new listings, the influx of new buyers entering the market meant that we sold all those homesâinventory simply could not keep up with all those buyers. Needless to say, buyer activity is super strong.Â The median sale price for condos in the Naples Beach area increased by 27%, going from $497,000 all the way up to $632,000 in just a year.Â In July 2018, we had a total of 774 home sales; this year, however, we had 829 sales, which is a 7.1% increase year over year. On a related note, single-family closed sales increased by 14.5% year over year, but closed condo sales remained flat at 394 both this and last July.So overall, our market is really on an upswing. For the most part, pricing really hasnât changed much except for the high-end condo segment mentioned earlier. Single-family home sales have either remained steady or have gone up, and because of limitations on the amount of land available, many are knocking down old homes and building new ones in their place. Weâre looking forward to a great September market, which is typically the slowest month we experience, but weâve already got a few closings coming up for the month.If youâre looking to buy or sell in the Naples area, donât hesitate to reach out to us. We hope to hear from you soon!",

        "content": "When it comes to helping people with their real estate needs, our team is committed to making your buying and selling experiences as smooth and successful as possible. This is why sellers who list with us have the unique opportunity to take advantage of our exclusive concierge program, which weâll be explaining in greater detail today.Â Before we do that, though, weâd like to remind you that even if youâre looking to sell outside of Florida, we have team members all across the nation who would be happy to help you achieve your goals. Better still, you can take advantage of our concierge program even if youâre selling out of state, so long as you do so with one of our agents.Â âWeâre happy to take care of any home improvement that will help you sell quickly and for more money.âWith that said, letâs delve deeper into what the concierge program is and how it can benefit you. In short, our concierge program lets you easily prepare your home for sale by fronting the cost of home improvement services like staging, painting, and more. The best part is that there are no hidden costs or fees. We simply take what you owe out of your closing costs at the end of the deal.Â Thereâs no real limit to the amount we can spend or the scale of the project we can take on. We can even go so far as to fully furnish a property, as we did recently in the case of one of the new construction homes weâre selling. Whether itâs remodeling, landscaping, upgrading, furnishing, or anything else, weâre happy to take care of any home improvement that will help you sell quickly and for more money.Â You can see the concierge program in action at one of our recent listings in the video above starting at 2:32.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "When a buyer is interested in a home, they sometimes think that theyâll only have to deal with the agent who is responsible for that listing. We receive calls all the time from clients who only want to speak with the listing agent.In general, buyers need to be better educated about what each agentâs role in their transaction will be. A buyerâs agent is one who works for the buyer, but who gets paid by the seller.Â When we take a listing, weâre representing the sellerâs interest. Our job for them is to get them the highest possible price in the shortest amount of time. But as a buyerâs agent, our job would be to fight to get you the best price, terms, and conditions. Listing agents canât, therefore, fill both roles.âYouâll want to speak with someone who is removed from the listing agent, since their job is to represent only the best interests of the seller.âAgents on either side of a transaction have a somewhat adversarial relationship with each other. Thatâs why we negotiate separately.Â So if youâre on the internet to shop for homes, reach out to us. Let us represent you as the buyer, because our job is to get you the lowest possible price, make sure youâre getting the correct inspections, and more. Youâll want to speak with someone who is removed from the listing agent, since their job is to represent only the best interests of the seller.Here in Naples, we often do represent both sides, but this is doable in a team settingâwhere one of our agents represents the seller, another can represent the buyer. We would be working as what is called a transaction broker, which is something weâve done in the case of, for example, a divorced couple.Ultimately, if youâre interested in a listing, itâs in your best agent to contact a buyerâs agent before the listing agent. That way, you know that youâre speaking to someone with your best interests at heart.If you have any questions about this or other real estate topics, please feel free to reach out to us. Weâd be glad to help you.",

Weâre still stuck with Comcast, but many people need better and faster internet. Weâve negotiated a deal with CenturyLink, who will bring high-speed internet to the entire community. In addition, another company will drill gas pipelines underground.Altogether, the cost would amount to around $1.1 million; however, the internet and gas companies have agreed to pay for almost all of the costs. In the end, our cost will only be about $300,000.This breaks down to $2,693 per single-family home. You can make a one-time payment or have the city of Naples spread it out through your tax bills over four years. If you have a condo, itâd be about $883 altogether. If you have gas already and would just be paying for internet, itâd be $633. If the vote goes through, theyâll be able to start building by fall.âWe have high hopes this will be complete by Christmas.âThese developments would help incredibly when it comes to resale value, and they would give the community a huge boost.Â Theyâll be very beneficial to you as a homeowner both now and in the future.Â Naples Council is going through an extensive approval process that we are hoping to be completed by Christmas.Â If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us.

        "content": "If you live in Naples or the surrounding area, odds are youâve been to the Naples Beach Hotel and Golf Club. This resort has been a part of Naples since 1947, and itâs an iconic part of our city.Â Last year, though, the Watkins familyâthe family who had owned the resort since its inceptionâannounced that they were selling the hotel and its surrounding property, including the golf course, to a Phoenix-based development company called The Athens Group, who intended to redevelop it. Â Just because weâre in real estate doesnât mean weâre pro-growth, but weâre very excited about this ongoing project. The Watkins family interviewed hundreds of potential buyers for this property, and we believe The Athens Group is the best candidate possible to update it while maintaining the integrity of historic downtown Naples. Though theyâre based in Phoenix, theyâve done some wonderful projects all across the US.âIf there is any developer who can come to Naples and do the job that should be done, itâs The Athens Group.âThis resort has been here for a long time, and when youâre facing a beach, some wear and tear is inevitable. As of now, there are 319 units, but The Athens Group plans on reducing that to 220, and their new condos will face both the beach side and the golfing side of the hotel. This reduction means that the hotel will be bought by a high-end luxury player. We donât know who this player is yet, but we think it will be a Four Seasons. Along with restoring the hotel, they plan on preserving the golf course in perpetuity.Weâve spoken to representatives from The Athens Group, and theyâre only asking for a couple of building variances, one of which is an 11-foot variance for the ceilings in the condos facing the beach, which we also approve of. On the first floor, theyâre building a bowling alley, a kidâs center, and tons of other family-friendly recreational areas.Â In addition to the hotel renovation, the landscaping theyâre doing throughout the city of Naples and all along the Gulf Shore Boulevard area is second to none. If there is any developer who can come to Naples and do the job that should be done, itâs The Athens Group.Â To learn more about this redevelopment project, click here.Â If you have any questions about this topic or you have any real estate needs that we can take care of, feel free to call or email us at your leisure.

Your former state probably has a rule that states if you live there for six months and a day, youâll be considered a full-time resident. But here, residency is about intent, not time spent.Todayâs video marks the beginning of a series in which Iâd like to clear up these false perceptions about domicile in Florida, starting with a few of the basics. To be considered a full-time resident in Florida, these are a few of the basic things youâll need to do:  Register your automobile  Get a Florida driverâs license  File a âDeclaration of Domicileâ form in the county where youâre choosing to live  Register to vote in the state of Florida  If youâre working, you need to work in the state, or at least establish an office here  File for homestead exemptionâthis is extremely important, and Iâll discuss it in more detail in a future video  Enroll your children in a Florida school  Pay Florida taxesâthe great thing about Florida is that we donât have any income tax or an estate taxIf itâs your intent to make Florida your home, be sure to notify your former state that youâll no longer be paying taxes in that state, that youâll be moving to Florida, and that youâll be filing your next return through Florida.âTodayâs video marks the beginning of a series in which Iâd like to clear up these false perceptions about domicile in Florida.âOther questions and misconceptions regarding buying or selling a home in Florida, how real estate agents are paid, who gets title insurance, and advanced estate-planning techniques and advanced estate-planning techniques will all addressed in my domicile seminars.I highly encourage you to stay tuned throughout this series, since weâll go through each topic in detail, some of which will include insight from guest speakers like estate attorneys and lenders.If you have any questions in the meantime, or if youâd like a free copy or PDF of my book, âDeclaring Florida Your Domicile: The Dos and Donâts of Florida Residencyâ, feel free to reach out to me directly.

The lowest sale was for $2.2 million, and the highest sale to date was $8.85 million. Believe it or not, the average days on market for this area was 229 days. Some sold in twice that time, so if youâre thinking of selling your Aqualane home, right now would be a good time to start. The average price per square foot was $1,036, shocking some people outside of the area. That translates to an average sale price of $4.57 million.âIt will still take a few months to sell your home, so if youâre planning to list, the time is now.âIn Royal Harbor, we sold 25 homes, ranging from a little less than $1 million to a little more than $4 million.

At the moment, we have 30 houses listed here, ranging from $1 million to $8 million in terms of price.Though we didnât mention them here, we do have the numbers regarding vacant lots and rentals in both of these areas.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The spike in inventory we noticed in October is, I think, a direct reflection of the fact that Hurricane Irma struck last September. Since then, weâve seen a big shift in our market; Â numbers have changed dramatically:  Overall inventory is up 20%. We have 5,990 homes currently on the market.Â   Of those homes, there are about 730 currently pending.  Our days on market is down to 93 days, an 11% drop. This is good news for sellers.Â   For October, we saw 674 overall closed sales. Of those, 366 are single-family homes, and the rest are condominium sales.  The median average price of closed sales is about $344,000.Historically in our market, inventory typically spikes in October because most sellers are preparing for what we consider the height of our season, which is right around Thanksgiving. Right after that time is when the most home sales are done, making it a prime time for sellers in Naples. At that point, weâre inundated with the most visitors weâll have throughout the year.I do, however, see an oversupply of homes, which are basically spec homes (brand-new homes that are completed before theyâre sold). The spec home market is geographically specific to the area west of U.S. Route 41 (the Tamiami Trail), which is closest to the Gulf of Mexico. A number of various areas here contain spec homes, including Olde Naples, Aqualane Shore, Port Royal, Â and the Moorings in Park Shore and Pelican Bay. The great news is that that market is a $2 million-and-above market. Weâve seen a huge 36% increase in sales there.If youâve been watching the news, Florida just had an election (like the rest of the country). We now happen to be in the news a little more: Part of our election in Florida included something called Amendment 2, which just passed.âNow sellers in Florida are protected against unchecked tax increases, and people looking for second homes and investment homes can rejoice.âAmendment 2âs passing is great news because it caps the amount of tax that is applied to your home for non-homestead individuals. That means for second-homebuyers, third-homebuyers, and others who arenât full-time residents wonât have to worry about the taxes for that area going up without an end in sight. Now sellers in Florida are protected against unchecked tax increases, and people looking for second homes and investment homes can rejoice.A really healthy market sits at about 5 to 5.5 monthsâ worth of homes; weâre currently at 7 to 7.5 monthsâ worth. As you can see, weâre a little bit higher in terms of inventory. However, some of that is skewed by the fact that there is new development in East Naples and Collier County. Because of that, it would appear weâre moving into a buyerâs market. Now, this can change quickly, as of our year-over-year numbers have gotten significantly better since Hurricane Irma. It took us months to clean up after that, and even today Iâm seeing homes that are just now finishing their new roofs and other interior remodeling.In the end, increasing inventory is good, since it means increased sales.If youâre looking for an agent who knows the market in our area, I would love to help you out. Reach out to us here at Napoleon Luxury Real Estate or visit our website to search for homes in the area just like the pros do. I look forward to hearing from you soon!",
