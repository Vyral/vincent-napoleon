<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Today we’re going to discuss bridge loans, a wonderful program that Compass just launched recently</em></p>

We are not lenders—we are Compass, a nationwide real estate company. We’re currently valued at around $6 billion and we’re debt-free. Because of that, we have some incredible programs that no other real estate companies offer, including bridge loans.

**A bridge loan bridges the gap between the buyer and the seller.** Let’s say you are buying a new home but your current house is for sale and hasn’t received an offer yet. We provide you a bridge loan that allows you to buy the home you want, then we can sell the home that you already own. We also pay all fees and expenses for the first six months, so you don’t have to worry about anything. And usually, your house will sell quicker than six months.&nbsp;

Our new program has launched nationwide. It’s wonderful because many investors come in with cash and buy the homes you may want. This way you have the freedom to sort of buy it with cash, not worry about having to sell your house first, and you can move into your new home immediately.&nbsp;

Currently, **inventory across the country is down,** nationwide more listings are needed. We’re heading into a seller’s market, and in that market, you’ve got to act hastily, be the first one with an offer, and this bridge loan allows you to be aggressive.&nbsp;

We have vetted many different lenders so that when someone’s interested in the program we can present them with a group of lenders that they can choose from to work with. You can work with whoever you want, but not everyone does bridge loans. Like any other loan, you have to apply, have a decent credit score, much of it will be based on the equity of the home you want to sell and the one you’re moving into. This is a great opportunity\!

**Interest rates are historically low,** it looks as though there’s going to be other rate cuts coming soon, and 2020 is an election year, so various things are happening. All the more reason a bridge loan makes sense\!&nbsp;

If you have any questions about the Bridge Loan Program or real estate, in general, please don’t hesitate to call or email us. We would love to help you\!
