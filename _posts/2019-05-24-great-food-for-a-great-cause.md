The Southwest Florida Sizzle is a 14-day, semi-annual, charity-driven event that gives locals (and visitors) the chance to channel their inner foodie and try all the restaurants on their wish list. **This year, the Sizzle will be held from May 30 to June 12**.

During this fantastic event, every restaurant from Cape Coral all the way to Marco Island and everywhere in between will participate in preparing some excellent lunches and dinners for a great cause. For every lunch or dinner purchased through the program, a dollar of the proceeds goes toward a scholarship fund for the Hospitality program at Florida Gulf Coast University.

**The Southwest Florida Sizzle program helps to educate students about the restaurant business**, and some of the finest restaurants in Naples are then able to hire locally when they graduate from Florida Gulf Coast University.

Or if youâ€™d like to join us for an outing at one of these great establishments, feel free to give us a call or send an email. We hope to hear from you soon\!
