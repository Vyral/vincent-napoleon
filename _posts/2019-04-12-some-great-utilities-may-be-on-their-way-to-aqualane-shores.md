Aqualane Shores is in the process of voting for the addition of two great new utilities: gas pipelines and high-speed internet. We’re still stuck with Comcast, but many people need better and faster internet. We’ve negotiated a deal with CenturyLink, who will bring high-speed internet to the entire community. In addition, another company will drill gas pipelines underground.

**Altogether, the cost would amount to around $1.1 million;** however, the internet and gas companies have agreed to pay for almost all of the costs. In the end, our cost will only be about $300,000.

This breaks down to $2,693 per single-family home. You can make a one-time payment or have the city of Naples spread it out through your tax bills over four years. If you have a condo, it’d be about $883 altogether. If you have gas already and would just be paying for internet, it’d be $633. **If the vote goes through, they’ll be able to start building by fall.**

These developments would help incredibly when it comes to resale value, and they would give the community a huge boost. If you haven’t already voted for these upgrades, we urge you to do so. **They’ll be very beneficial to you as a homeowner both now and in the future.**
