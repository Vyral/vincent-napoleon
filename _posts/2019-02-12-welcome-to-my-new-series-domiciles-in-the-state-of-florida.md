For many years, I’ve been hosting domicile seminars, which provide information for new residents coming into Florida.

I’ve found that there is a misconception that residency in Florida is “six months and one day”—but that’s a fallacy.Your former state probably has a rule that states if you live there six months and a day, you’ll be considered a full-time resident. But here, residency is about intent, not time spent.

Today’s video marks the beginning of a series in which I’d like to clear up these false perceptions about domiciles in Florida, beginning by covering a few of the basics. To be considered a full-time resident in Florida, these are a few of the basic things you’ll need to do:

* Register your automobile
* Get a Florida driver’s license
* File a “Declaration of Domicile” form in the county where you’re choosing to live
* Register to vote in the state of Florida
* If you’re working, you need to work in the state, or at least establish an office here
* File for homestead exemption—this is extremely important, and I’ll discuss it in more detail in a future video
* Enroll your children in a Florida school
* Paying Florida taxes—the great thing about Florida is that we don’t have any income tax or an estate tax

If it’s your intent to make Florida your home, be sure to notify your former state that you no longer going to be paying taxes in that state, that you’ll be moving to Florida, and that you’ll be filing your next return through Florida.

Other questions and misconceptions regarding buying or selling a home in Florida, how real estate agents are paid, who gets title insurance, and advanced estate-planning techniques—these are all addressed in my domicile seminars.

I highly encourage you to stay tuned throughout this series, since we’ll go through each topic in detail, some of which will include insight from guest speakers like estate attorneys and lenders.

If you have any questions in the meantime, or if you’d like a free copy or PDF of my book, “[TITLE UNSTATED BY CLIENT]”, feel free to reach out to me directly. I’d love to send you a copy.
