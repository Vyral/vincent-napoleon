There are plenty of fun things to do here in Naples, and today we just want to share a few local attractions you might enjoy. 

If you’re into fine dining, there are so many great restaurants here that you’ll never have to visit the same one twice. This past month, for example, a new Rocco’s Tacos opened in Mercato—we went there recently, and it was fantastic. The intersection at 5th Avenue and 3rd Street, in particular, is a hotspot for some great restaurants.

If you’re a boater, there are plenty of places you can go to as well. The Hamilton Harbor Yacht Club is a great private club where you can pull your boat into Bay Front. The Dock and The Boathouse are two other great restaurants in that area. 

**If you’re looking to move to Naples, our team also has a few great new listings coming on the market soon**, including one in Aqualane Shores that’s right on a canal and one on Gordon Street, which is within walking distance to all those great restaurants on 3rd Street. 

If you’d like to learn more about all the great restaurants in our area, I recommend checking out [this article](https://www.gulfshorelife.com/2018/05/18/the-26-best-southwest-florida-restaurants/){: target="_blank"} from Gulfshore Life.
