*Today let’s take a look at how the Naples-area market has changed since last year.*

In today’s market report for the summer of 2019, we first want to clear up the misconception that summer is a slow time for the Naples market. People tend to believe that nobody buys in the summer and that you can only list your house in the winter months because that’s when everybody is here, but that’s just not true.

**As of July 2019, our agents have had 17,000 appointments to show various properties in the Naples area**, which is fantastic. To dig even deeper into that, we also found that each buyer averaged 17 showings before making a purchase. Keep that in mind if you haven’t found the right home by your fifth or so home tour.

For inventory, we had about 5,200 homes on the market in July this year, including condos and single-family homes.

Our current list-to-sold ratio in the market is 96%, and our list-to-sales price ratio was 90%. Kimberley and I happen to get an average of 97% of the listing price for our sellers, which is a pretty good market total.

In July, we closed 435 single-family home sales and 394 condo sales.

Overall, sellers added 935 new listings to the market. The interesting part about that is that **even with 935 new listings, the influx of new buyers entering the market meant that we sold all those homes**—inventory simply could not keep up with all those buyers. Needless to say, buyer activity is super strong.&nbsp;

The median sale price for condos in the Naples Beach area increased by 27%, going from $497,000 all the way up to $632,000 in just a year.&nbsp;

In July 2018, we had a total of 774 home sales; this year, however, we had 829 sales, which is a 7.1% increase year over year. On a related note, single-family closed sales increased by 14.5% year over year, but closed condo sales remained flat at 394 both this and last July.

So overall, our market is really on an upswing. For the most part, pricing really hasn’t changed much except for the high-end condo segment mentioned earlier. Single-family home sales have either remained steady or have gone up, and because of limitations on the amount of land available, many are knocking down old homes and building new ones in their place. **We’re looking forward to a great September market**, which is typically the slowest month we experience, but we’ve already got a few closings coming up for the month.

If you’re looking to buy or sell in the Naples area, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We hope to hear from you soon\!
