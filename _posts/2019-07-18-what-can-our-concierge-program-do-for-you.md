When it comes to helping people with their real estate needs, our team is committed to making your buying and selling experiences as smooth and successful as possible. This is why **sellers who list with us have the unique opportunity to take advantage of our exclusive concierge program,** which we’ll be explaining in greater detail today.&nbsp;

Before we do that, though, we’d like to remind you that even if you’re looking to sell outside of Florida, we have team members all across the nation who would be happy to help you achieve your goals. Better still, you can take advantage of our concierge program even if you’re selling out of state, so long as you do so with one of our agents.&nbsp;

With that said, let’s delve deeper into what the concierge program is and how it can benefit you. In short, **our concierge program lets you easily prepare your home for sale by fronting the cost of home improvement services like staging, painting and more.** The best part is that there are no hidden costs or fees. We simply take what you owe out of your closing costs at the end of the deal.&nbsp;

There’s no real limit to the amount we can spend or the scale of the project we can take on. We can even go so far as to fully furnish a property, as we did recently in the case of one of the new construction homes we’re selling. Whether it’s remodeling, landscaping, upgrading, furnishing, or anything else, we’re happy to take care of any home improvement that will help you sell quickly and for more money.&nbsp;

**You can see the concierge program in action at one of our recent listings in the video above starting at 2:32.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
