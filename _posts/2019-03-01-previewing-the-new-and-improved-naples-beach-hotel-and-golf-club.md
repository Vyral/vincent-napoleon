If you live in Naples or the surrounding area, odds are you’ve been to the Naples Beach Hotel and Golf Club. This resort has been a part of Naples since 1947, and it’s an iconic part of our city.&nbsp;

Last year, though, the Watkins family—the family who had owned the resort since its inception—announced that they were selling the hotel and its surrounding property, including the golf course, to a Phoenix-based development company called The Athens Group, who intended to redevelop it. &nbsp;

Just because we’re in real estate doesn’t mean we’re pro-growth, but we’re very excited about this ongoing project. The Watkins family interviewed hundreds of potential buyers for this property, and **we believe The Athens Group is the best candidate possible to update it while maintaining the integrity of historic downtown Naples.** Though they’re based in Phoenix, they’ve done some wonderful projects all across the US.

This resort has been here for a long time, and when you’re facing a beach, some wear and tear is inevitable. As of now, there are 319 units, but The Athens Group plans on reducing that to 220, and their new condos will face both the beach side and the golfing side of the hotel. This reduction means that the hotel will be bought by a high-end luxury player. We don’t know who this player is yet, but we think it will be a Four Seasons. **Along with restoring the hotel, they plan on preserving the golf course in perpetuity.**

We’ve spoken to representatives from The Athens Group, and they’re only asking for a couple of building variances, one of which is an 11-foot variance for the ceilings in the condos facing the beach, which we also approve of. On the first floor, they’re building a bowling alley, a kid’s center, and tons of other family-friendly recreational areas.&nbsp;

In addition to the hotel renovation, the landscaping they’re doing throughout the city of Naples and all along the Gulf Shore Boulevard area is second to none. **If there is any developer who can come to Naples and do the job that should be done, it’s The Athens Group.&nbsp;**
