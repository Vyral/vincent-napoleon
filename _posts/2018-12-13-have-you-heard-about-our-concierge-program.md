We’ve got some really exciting news to share with you today: We have a brand-new concierge program for home sellers. If you want to sell your house, but you think that there’s too much to do in preparation for the sale, we’ll put up the money for it right from the outset. We’ll do all the cleaning, the staging, the lawn care, the painting, and whatever else needs to be done to get your home sold for top dollar. We’re excited to offer this service, and we hope you’ll take advantage of it. To learn more about the program, watch this short video.
