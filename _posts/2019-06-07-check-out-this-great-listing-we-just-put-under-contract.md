Our team recently put an incredible property under contract for $5.2 million within just eight days of it being on the market, and we see this as a testament to just how effective our approach to real estate truly is.&nbsp;

With that said, allow us to tell you a little more about this great property. 3215 Crayton Road is a 2-story, 5,700-square foot home with plenty of space and amenities both inside and out. **You can watch a full tour of this fabulous home in today’s video starting at 2:19.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information about how we help buyers and sellers achieve their real estate goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
