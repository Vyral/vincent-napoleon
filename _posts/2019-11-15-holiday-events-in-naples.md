Today we’re sharing some upcoming seasonal events in Naples that you won’t want to miss\!

The holidays are approaching, so we wanted to share some events happening in Naples this season. Also, welcome back all of you who leave in the summer and come back in the winter—we’re happy to have you\!

**\-Naples Boat Parade:** The Christmas boat parade is incredible. All the boats are lit up at night, they come through Naples Bay, and they even have a bourbon tasting boat. Don’t miss it on December 14.

**\-Third street Christmas tree lighting ceremony:** They make it snow (fake snow) and you can play in the snow in your shorts.

**\-Night Lights - Naples Botanical Garden:** This awesome event runs from November 29 through January 1. They light up everything in the gardens. Bring the family, because it’s one of the loveliest things to see in Naples.&nbsp;

**\-Venitian Village’s Christmas tree lighting.**

For the second part of today’s video, starting at 2:02, we filmed our visit to Dolce & Salato—Vincent’s favorite Italian restaurant. Owner Natasha is from the northern part of Italy, her business partner Agostino is from Rome, and they have owned the restaurant for eight years. They try to keep with Italian traditions. They are usually open for breakfast and lunch, but during the holiday season, they’ll be open in the evenings on weekends as well. They are located on the corner of third and fifth. Check it out\!
