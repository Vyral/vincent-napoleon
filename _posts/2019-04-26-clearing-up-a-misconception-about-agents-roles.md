  With the help of my partner, Kimberly Alvord, today I want to debunk a myth
  regarding buyer’s and seller’s agents.

When a buyer is interested in a home, they sometimes think that they’ll only have to deal with the agent who is responsible for that listing. We receive calls all the time from clients who only want to speak with the listing agent.

**In general, buyers need to be better educated about what each agent’s role in their transaction will be.** A buyer’s agent is one who works for the buyer, but who gets paid by the seller.&nbsp;

When we take a listing, we’re representing the seller’s interest. Our job for them is to get them the highest possible price in the shortest amount of time. But as a buyer’s agent, our job would be to fight to get you the best price, terms, and conditions. Listing agents can’t, therefore, fill both roles.

Agents on either side of a transaction have a somewhat adversarial relationship with each other. That’s why we negotiate separately.&nbsp;

So **if you’re on the internet to shop for homes, reach out to us.** Let us represent you as the buyer, because our job is to get you the lowest possible price, make sure you’re getting the correct inspections, and more. You’ll want to speak with someone who is removed from the listing agent, since their job is to represent only the best interests of the seller.

Here in Naples, we often do represent both sides, but this is doable in a team setting—where one of our agents represents the seller, another can represent the buyer. We would be working as what is called a transaction broker, which is something we’ve done in the case of, for example, a divorced couple.

Ultimately, **if you’re interested in a listing, it’s in your best agent to contact a buyer’s agent before the listing agent.** That way, you know that you’re speaking to someone with your best interests at heart.

If you have any questions about this or other real estate topics, please feel free to reach out to us. We’d be glad to help you.
