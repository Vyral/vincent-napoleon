To close out the year, today’s market update will focus on two neighborhoods that are near and dear to our hearts: Aqualane Shores and Royal Harbor.

In Aqualane Shores, we’ve had 23 closed home sales. **The lowest sale was for $2.2 million, and the highest sale to date was $8.85 million.** Believe it or not, the average days on market for this area was 229 days. Some sold in twice that time, so **if you’re thinking of selling your Aqualane home, right now would be a good time to start.** The average price per square foot was $1,036, shocking some people outside of the area. That translates to an average sale price of $4.57 million.

**In Royal Harbor, we sold 25 homes, ranging from a little less than $1 million to a little more than $4 million.** The average days on market for Royal Harbor was less than that of Aqualane Shores, averaging out at 125 days. It will still take a few months to sell your home, so if you’re planning to list here, the time is now. At the moment, we have 30 houses listed here, ranging from $1 million to $8 million in terms of price.

Though we didn’t mention them here, we do have the numbers regarding vacant lots and rentals in both of these areas. If you would like to see those figures or if you have any questions regarding buying or selling homes in Aqualane Shores or Royal Harbor, please reach out to us anytime. Until then, happy holidays!
